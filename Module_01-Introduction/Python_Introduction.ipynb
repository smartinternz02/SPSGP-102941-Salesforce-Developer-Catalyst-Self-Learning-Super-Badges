        "\n",
        "* **Interpreted**: a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. (Compiled languages: Go, C++)\n",
        "* **Object Oriented**: a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields.\n",
        "* **Object**: An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object. We can think of a class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc.\n",
        "* **High-Level Language**: A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages. Python, C#, C++, PHP, Java vs assembly language and machine code\n",
        "* **Dynamic Semantics**: dynamic objects are instances of values contained into constructs in the code, and they exist at run-time level. Furthermore, we can assign to one object multiple values, since it will update itself, differently from a static semantic language. Namely, if we set a=2 and then a=’hello’, the string value will substitute the integer one as soon as the line is executed\n",
        "* **Built-In Data Structures**: Organizing, managing, and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. Data Structures allows you to organize your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly. Python has implicit support for Data Structures which enable you to store and access data. Some of these structures are called List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.\n",
        "* **Dynamic Typing**: The term dynamic typing means that a compiler or an interpreter assigns a type to all the variables at run-time. The type of a variable is decided based on its value. The programs written using dynamic-typed languages are more flexible but will compile even if they contain errors.\n"

This allows the compiler to create highly optimized machine code that can execute very efficiently. There is no need for extra checks during runtime, which saves processing time.\n",
        "* **Dynamic Typing**: With dynamic typing, the program must perform type checks on the fly, as the code is being executed. This adds a small overhead to every operation, as the program has to determine the type of the variable at that exact moment. This continuous process of checking types at runtime makes dynamically typed languages inherently slower than their statically typed counterparts.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this performance difference exists, it's often not a major issue for most applications. The speed and flexibility of dynamic languages like Python make them ideal for many tasks, such as scripting, web development, and data analysis, where development speed is more important than raw execution speed. For applications where performance is critical (like system software, game engines, or high-frequency trading), a statically typed language is usually the better choice."

This helps to conserve memory and improve the performance of operations involving these numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python pre-caches or \"interns\" a range of integers, typically from -5 to 256. When you create a new integer variable within this range, Python doesn't create a new object. Instead, it reuses the existing, single object for that number. This is why if you check the memory addresses of two separate variables assigned the same integer in this range, they will be identical"
